# GSoC2017 for Boost.Geometry
## Programming Compentency Test
### Source Code
All the source code are in the file called "ProgrammingTest", and the README.md of it is the a rest of testcase which I used to test the correct of my code, all the functions in code is tested by myself so it may have little bugs. Every time you find bugs, it is very kind of you to send it to me using issue pages.

earth_point_GreatCircle.hpp is the point on the earth with spherical model.
earth_point.hpp is the point on the earth with ellipsoidal model.

## Issue Pages
There are the records of my ToDo list of project in GSoC2017 of Boost.Geometry and your issue about my project. :)
